# 'Doge' Attack! 

## Theme: 60 Second game 

## How to play:

Press up/down/left/right on keyboard to move 'Doge' around the screen. Accumulate as many points as you can before time reaches 60 seconds. 
You can accumulate points by 'annoying' the grumpy cat that appears at different locations on the screen. 'Annoy' the grumpy cat by bringing 'Doge' to touch it. 
Good luck!

## Premise:

Introducing 'Doge', the world's favourite internet dog. 'Doge' is your sprite that you will control in this game. 
'Doge' is on a mission to annoy the world's infamous 'grumpy cat'. 'Grumpy Cat' gets easily annoyed by being near 'Doge', thus running away and appearing in different locations on screen. 
We challenge you to see how many points you are able to accumulate in this game within 60 seconds!
