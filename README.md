# 'Do(d)ge' Attack! 

## Theme: 60 Second game 

## How to Run:
### Windows

Each project folder will contain a UbiGame.sln file that can be opened with Visual Studio (Community version is free).

### The MacOS version is based on a Makefile.

The process is the following:

- Open a console at the project folder.
- run make to build
- run ./output to run the game

## How to Play
Press up/down/left/right on keyboard to move 'Doge' around the screen. Accumulate as many points as you can before time reaches 60 seconds. 
You can accumulate points by 'annoying' the grumpy cat that appears at different locations on the screen. 'Annoy' the grumpy cat by bringing 'Doge' to touch it. 
Good luck!

## Premise:

Introducing 'Doge', the world's favourite internet dog. 'Doge' is your sprite that you will control in this game. 
'Doge' is on a mission to annoy the world's infamous 'grumpy cat'. 'Grumpy Cat' gets easily annoyed by being near 'Doge', thus running away and appearing in different locations on screen. 
We challenge you to see how many points you are able to accumulate in this game within 60 seconds! 

## Inspiration:

Our team wanted to create a fun game that people can play to relief stress during this pandemic. 
We wanted our players to have a good laugh from our comical premise, all while having a smooth gaming experience. 

FUN FACT: The sprites used ('Doge' and 'Grumpy Cat') were drawn by ourselves during this hackathon! We decided to have a little fun and explore some pixel art and animation. 

## Challenges:

Not only were we 1 person short in our team, but majority of us were new to C++. 
It was certainly challenging to pick up the language and create a game in a matter of hours, but very fufilling when we succeeded in producing a fun game that we're proud of.
